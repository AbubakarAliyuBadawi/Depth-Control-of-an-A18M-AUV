# Depth Control of A18M Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller to enhance the depth control of the A18M Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) used primarily for underwater mine detection. The controller aims to minimize pitch oscillations and improve the stability of the AUV in a dynamic underwater environment.

### Objectives
- To replace the traditional PID controller with a more robust LQR controller.
- To achieve precise depth control with minimized pitch oscillations.
- To simulate and test the controller's performance using MATLAB and Simulink.
